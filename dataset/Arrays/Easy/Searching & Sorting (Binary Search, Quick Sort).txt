​Searching and sorting algorithms are fundamental components in computer science, enabling efficient data retrieval and organization.
These algorithms range from basic techniques suitable for simple tasks to advanced methods designed for complex scenarios.
Searching is the process of finding a specific element or value within a data structure like an array, list, or database.
Searching algorithms are mainly categorized into linear and non-linear based on the traversal pattern.
The goal of searching is to determine whether an element exists in a collection and, if it does, to find its position.
Linear Search checks each element sequentially and is simple but inefficient for large datasets.
Binary Search is efficient on sorted arrays and works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
Interpolation Search and Exponential Search are optimized versions of Binary Search for specific scenarios.
Jump Search reduces the number of comparisons by checking fixed intervals and then performing linear search within the block.
Ternary Search is an extension of Binary Search, splitting the array into three parts.
Searching algorithms differ in their time complexity, with Linear Search being O(n), and Binary Search, Ternary Search being O(log n).
The efficiency of a search operation depends on whether the data is sorted and the structure used (e.g., arrays, trees, hash tables).
Searching is a fundamental operation in computing, used in applications like databases, information retrieval, and AI.

Sorting is the process of arranging data in a particular order, typically ascending or descending.
Sorting algorithms are classified as comparison-based (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort) and non-comparison-based (e.g., Radix Sort, Bucket Sort).
Efficient sorting helps improve the performance of other algorithms like searching and merging.
Bubble Sort and Selection Sort are simple but inefficient for large datasets due to their O(n²) time complexity.
Merge Sort and Quick Sort are more efficient with average complexities of O(n log n).
Insertion Sort performs well on small or nearly sorted datasets.
Heap Sort uses a binary heap and provides consistent O(n log n) performance.
Radix Sort and Bucket Sort are linear-time algorithms used for specific kinds of inputs like integers or floats.
Shell Sort improves upon Insertion Sort by initially comparing elements far apart, reducing the gap over time.
Stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of equal elements (e.g., Merge Sort, Bubble Sort).
Unstable sorts like Quick Sort may change the order of equal elements unless modified.
Sorting is crucial in algorithms like binary search, data analysis, report generation, and visualization.
Space complexity is also a consideration; some sorting algorithms require extra memory (Merge Sort), while others are in-place (Quick Sort).
Internal sorting happens in memory, while external sorting handles large datasets using disk or secondary storage.
The choice of sorting algorithm depends on factors like data size, distribution, stability requirements, and available memory.
Sorting is often a preprocessing step for optimization in large systems and real-time applications.

Linear Search is a straightforward method that sequentially checks each element in a list until the target value is found or the list ends.​
Use Cases of Linear Search is that it is effective for small or unsorted datasets.​
Time Complexity of Linear Search is O(n), where n is the number of elements.​
Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that checks each element of a list one by one.
Linear search starts from the first element and moves sequentially through the list.
Linear search compares each element with the target value.
In Linear search if a match is found, the search stops, and the position of the element is returned.
In Linear search if the end of the list is reached without finding the target, the search concludes that the element is not present.
Linear search does not require the list to be sorted.
Linear search works on both arrays and linked lists.
Linear search is easy to implement and understand.
Linear search is not efficient for large datasets because it checks every element.
The worst-case time complexity of Linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements.
The best-case time complexity of Linear search is O(1), when the element is found at the beginning.
The average-case time complexity of Linear search is O(n/2), simplified as O(n).
Linear search has a space complexity of O(1), as it uses constant extra space.
Linear search is suitable for small or unsorted datasets.
Linear search is also called sequential search.


Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.​

Bubble sort swaps the elements if they are in the wrong order.
Bubble sort continues the process until no more swaps are needed.
Bubble sort ensures the largest element moves to the end in each pass.
Bubble sort performs multiple passes over the list.
Bubble sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), where n is the number of elements.
Bubble sort has a best-case time complexity of O(n) when the list is already sorted.

Bubble sort has a space complexity of O(1), as it sorts in-place.
Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement.
Bubble sort is inefficient for large datasets due to its high time complexity.
Bubble sort is stable, meaning it preserves the order of equal elements.
Bubble sort is suitable for educational purposes and small datasets.
Bubble sort gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

Selection Sort divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region; repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the sorted region.​
Use Cases of Selection Sort is that it can be used in situations where memory writes are costly.​
Time Complexity of Selection Sort is O(n²) in the worst case.
Selection sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted part.
In each iteration, selection sort finds the minimum element from the unsorted part.
The minimum element found by selection sort is then swapped with the first unsorted element.
After each pass, selection sort increases the size of the sorted portion by one.
Selection sort performs this process until the entire list becomes sorted.
Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n²) in the best, average, and worst cases.
Space complexity of selection sort is O(1) since it performs in-place sorting.
Selection sort is not a stable algorithm because equal elements may not retain their relative order.
Selection sort makes fewer swaps compared to bubble sort, which can be beneficial in certain situations.
Selection sort is easy to understand and implement for beginners.
Selection sort is inefficient on large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.
Selection sort always scans the entire unsorted part of the array to find the minimum element.
Selection sort is mainly used in situations where memory writes are costly and the number of swaps needs to be minimized.​

Insertion Sort builds the sorted list one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position.​

Time Complexity is O(n²) in the worst case; O(n) when the list is already sorted.
Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time.
In each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data and finds the correct position within the sorted part.
