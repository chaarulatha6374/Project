A prefix sum array is a technique used to compute the sum of elements in a range efficiently.
The prefix sum array stores the cumulative sum of elements from the start of the array.
It helps in answering range sum queries in constant time O(1) after preprocessing.
The first element of the prefix sum array is the same as the first element of the original array.
Each prefix sum value is computed by adding the previous sum to the current element.
The prefix sum formula is prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + arr[i].
Once the prefix sum array is built, finding the sum of any subarray is efficient.
To find the sum between two indices L and R, use prefix[R] - prefix[L - 1].
Prefix sum reduces the time complexity of multiple range sum queries from O(n) to O(1).
The prefix sum technique is widely used in competitive programming and data analysis.
It is useful for financial data processing, such as calculating cumulative revenue.

Prefix sums make it easier to calculate moving averages in time-series data.
A variation of the prefix sum technique is the modular prefix sum, used in cyclic calculations.
Parallel computing uses prefix sum in GPU programming for fast array operations.
Prefix sum can be extended to circular arrays, making it useful for buffered data processing.
A difference array helps efficiently update multiple elements in an array.
It allows fast range updates without modifying each element individually.
The difference array stores the change between consecutive elements of an array.
The formula for computing a difference array is diff[i] = arr[i] - arr[i - 1].
If we want to update a range [L, R] by adding X, we modify diff[L] += X and diff[R+1] -= X.
The original array is reconstructed by taking the prefix sum of the difference array.
