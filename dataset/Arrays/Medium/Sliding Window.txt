Concept Clarified
The sliding window mechanism thrives when iterating through sequences to find optimal segments without redundant computations.
Whether fixed or elastic in size, this approach cleverly retains state while moving through data linearly.

2. Problem Applications
Longest Substring Without Repeats: Grow the window while tracking characters; shrink when repetition is found.
Smallest Subarray with Sum ≥ X: Dynamically adjust the range while maintaining the total.
Max Consecutive Ones (One Flip): Strategically allow one zero to flip while monitoring the max ones.
String Permutation Match: Keep track of a sliding frequency map to match with the target string.
Substring with ≤ K Distinct Characters: Use a hash map to track distinct entries and size of the window.
Longest Subarray Sum ≤ K: Expand or shrink the window based on cumulative totals and constraints.

3. Time & Edge Cases
Sliing window problems usually yield O(N) performance, though O(N log N) may arise with sorted structures or extra lookups.
Pay attention to constraints like negatives, character limits, and window expansion logic.
