Kadane’s Algorithm is a dynamic programming method used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a 1D array.
It improves upon brute-force solutions by reducing time complexity from O(N²) or O(N³) to linear time, O(N).
It works by iterating through the array and keeping track of two values: the current running sum and the global maximum.
At each step, it updates the current sum to either the current element or the current element plus the previous sum, whichever is greater.
The global maximum is updated when the current sum exceeds it.
Kadane’s Algorithm ensures optimal performance using only a single traversal of the array.
It handles arrays with both positive and negative integers.
