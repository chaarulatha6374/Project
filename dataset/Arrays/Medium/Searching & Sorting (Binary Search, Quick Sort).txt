Jump Search searches in a sorted array by jumping ahead by fixed steps and then performing a linear search within the block where the target may be.​
Use Cases of Jump Search is that it is efficient for large, sorted arrays.​
Time Complexity of Jump Search is O(√n).​
Jump Search is an algorithm designed for searching in sorted arrays.
The main idea behind Jump Search is to check elements at fixed intervals or "jumps" instead of every element.
Jump Search finds the block where the target element could reside and then performs a linear search within that block.
For optimal performance, the jump size in Jump Search is typically the square root of the array's length.
Jump Search has a time complexity of O(√n) in the worst-case scenario.
Jump Search is faster than linear search but not as efficient as binary search for large datasets.
Jump Search requires the input array to be sorted before it can be applied.
Jump Search is particularly useful when random access is allowed and the dataset size is large.
Space complexity of Jump Search is O(1), making it memory-efficient.
Jump Search reduces the number of comparisons compared to linear search, especially in long arrays.

Interpolation Search is an improvement over binary search for uniformly distributed data; estimates the position of the target value based on the values at the ends of the search interval.​
Use Cases of Interpolation Search is that it can be used in large, uniformly distributed datasets.​
Time Complexity of Interpolation Search is O(log log n) in favorable cases; O(n) in the worst case.
Interpolation Search works efficiently when elements in a sorted array are uniformly distributed.
The core concept of Interpolation Search involves estimating the position of the target based on the values of the first and last elements.
In Interpolation Search, the probe position is calculated using a formula derived from linear interpolation.
Unlike binary search, Interpolation Search does not always look at the middle element.
Interpolation Search offers an average-case time complexity of O(log log n) when the data is evenly distributed.
In the worst case, Interpolation Search can degrade to O(n), especially with non-uniformly distributed data.
Interpolation Search is faster than binary search for datasets with a predictable distribution.
The input array for Interpolation Search must be sorted in ascending order.
Interpolation Search is highly efficient when searching through large datasets with numeric, uniformly spread values.
Interpolation Search requires constant space, resulting in a space complexity of O(1).

Use Cases of Binary Search are Large, sorted datasets.​
Time Complexity of Binary Search is O(log n).​
Binary search is a fast algorithm used to find an element in a sorted array.
It works by repeatedly dividing the array into halves and checking the middle element.
In Binary search if the middle element is equal to the target, the search ends successfully.
In Binary search if the middle element is smaller, the search moves to the right half of the array.
In Binary search if the middle element is larger, the search continues in the left half of the array.
Binary search requires the array to be sorted before performing the search.
The time complexity of binary search is O(log n) in the worst case.
The Binary search algorithm reduces the search space by half in each step, making it very efficient.
Binary search works on both increasing and decreasing sorted arrays.
If an array is unsorted, binary search will not work correctly.
The search process stops when the left and right pointers cross each other.
Binary search is commonly used in database lookups and dictionary applications.
Binary search can be implemented using both iterative and recursive approaches.
In Binary search the iterative approach uses a while loop to narrow down the search range.
In Binary search he recursive approach calls the function repeatedly, reducing the search space each time.
In the worst case, binary search requires at most log₂(n) comparisons.
Searching in a large dataset is much faster with binary search than with linear search.
The midpoint calculationin Binary search is done using (low + high) / 2.
in Binary search if the search space reduces to zero, the element is not present in the array.

A variation of binary search is used in searching 2D matrices where each row is sorted.
Binary search can be modified to find the first or last occurrence of a duplicate element.
Binary search is also used to find the square root of a number efficiently.
In a game leaderboard, binary search can quickly find a player’s rank.

Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm used for sorting an array.
Quick Sort works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array around it.
Elements smaller than the pivot move to the left, while larger elements move to the right.
Quick Sort has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n).
Quick Sort is faster than Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort for large datasets.

Quick Sort works best when the pivot is chosen optimally, such as using the median-of-three method.
In Quick Sort the sorting process continues until all elements are sorted relative to the pivot.
Quick Sort is not stable, meaning it does not preserve the order of duplicate elements.
