Optimized Techniques for Intermediate Problems
The two-pointer method shines when paired with sorting or window-based techniques.
The two-pointer method reduces the time for intersection, union, and nearest pair-type problems.
The The two-pointer method is often used in dynamic subarrays or binary-based arrays where traversal is conditional.

Standard Medium-Level Challenges:
Intersection of Sorted Arrays: Pointers walk through both arrays to find common elements in linear time.
Union of Sorted Arrays: Pointers gather all unique elements while skipping duplicates.
Sort 0s, 1s, and 2s (Dutch Flag): A trio of pointers partitions the array with just one pass.
Closest Pair to Target Sum: Pointers converge to find the nearest sum to a given value.
Max Consecutive 1s: A window slides to count the longest streak of ones.
Longest Subarray with Sum â‰¤ K: Pointers shift range boundaries to track a valid subarray under the sum threshold.

Complexity and Care
The time complexity of Two-Pointer problems are mostly are O(N) or O(N log N) depending on pre-sorting.
Edge cases in two-pointer technique involve duplicates, negative numbers, and tight constraints.
Sliding windows often require one direction movement for correctness.
