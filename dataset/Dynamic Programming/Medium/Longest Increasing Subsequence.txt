Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) identifies the length of the longest subsequence in which each element is greater than the previous one.
A subsequence does not require contiguous elements but must maintain the original order.
In LIS, each new number in the sequence must be strictly greater than the one before it.
The goal is to determine the maximum length possible under these conditions.
For every element, potential subsequences ending at earlier elements must be checked.
A dynamic programming approach stores intermediate results to build up to the final answer.
Each index is initialized with the value 1, signifying that a single element itself is a valid subsequence.
For each element at index i, previous indices j are checked where j < i.
If the current element is greater than a previous one, and its LIS value is higher, we update.
The DP array is updated to reflect the best LIS that can end at that index.
The maximum value in the DP array after the process gives the LIS length.
The time complexity of this solution is O(nÂ²), where n is the length of the array.
An optimization can be done using binary search, reducing the complexity to O(n log n).
The optimized method maintains a temporary list representing the ends of LIS candidates.
A binary search is used to find the position to replace or extend the temporary list.
Although the actual sequence may not be preserved in the optimized list, its length is accurate.
This list is not the LIS itself but helps in determining the length of LIS.
In sorted arrays, the LIS is the array itself.
In reverse-sorted arrays, the LIS is always 1.
The LIS does not allow repeated elements unless they are strictly increasing.
It is possible to reconstruct the LIS by storing predecessor indices during computation.
LIS is a classic dynamic programming problem with overlapping subproblems.
The problem exhibits optimal substructure since the solution can be built from smaller solutions.
Recursive approaches can solve the problem, but they are inefficient without memoization.
Memoization helps avoid recalculating solutions for the same subproblem.
The difference between subsequences and substrings is crucial when working with LIS.
Substrings require continuity, whereas subsequences do not.
LIS can be adapted to work on sequences of characters or other comparable values.
The problem extends to applications such as stock market trend analysis.
LIS plays a role in measuring consistency and improvement over time.
A variation includes finding not just the length but also the number of LIS paths.
To do this, we track both the length and count for each element.
When an equal LIS length is found, the count is incremented.
The sum of all counts where LIS length equals the maximum gives the total LIS count.
LIS has direct use in solving the patience sorting algorithm.
Patience sorting is an efficient sorting method that mirrors the LIS logic.
LIS is used in file comparison algorithms to identify longest matches.
In genome analysis, LIS helps align gene sequences optimally.
It is also used in tracking personal progress over time, such as weight or scores.
LIS shows how far one can go with consistent improvement in values.
The concept of LIS can be visualized using graph theory by forming a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
Each edge points from a smaller number to a larger number with a valid increasing connection.
Finding LIS in such a graph is equivalent to finding the longest path.
However, LIS is more efficiently solved using DP or binary search than with graphs.
LIS is often used as a subroutine in more complex problems.
It appears in competitive programming due to its versatility.
LIS generalizes to multidimensional data like LIS in 2D arrays.
LIS variants include Longest Bitonic Subsequence and Longest Decreasing Subsequence.
Another variation includes finding LIS with constraints, like bounded difference.
LIS appears in coding platforms such as LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank.
Binary search in LIS is used to find the correct position to insert or replace an element.
This ensures that the temporary list is always in increasing order with minimal end values.
The length of the temporary list remains accurate because it preserves increasing order.
Replacing a value in the temporary list does not affect correctness.
The temporary list represents the smallest possible ending values for subsequences.
Multiple increasing subsequences can exist in an array, but LIS focuses only on the longest.
In binary search-based LIS, duplicates are handled by ensuring strict comparison.
Arrays with all identical values always yield LIS of 1.
Negative values in the input sequence do not affect the working of the LIS algorithm.
The algorithm remains applicable for any comparable data type.
Dynamic programming allows for bottom-up tabulation of LIS.
Tabulation helps avoid recursion stack overhead.
The DP array can be visualized as a histogram of maximum subsequence lengths.
Visual tools can aid in understanding how LIS evolves across positions.
LIS is often taught early in DP curriculum for its foundational nature.
Some implementations track both value and index for backtracking LIS sequence.
Reconstructing the LIS requires keeping track of previous indices.
Reconstruction is optional but useful in understanding actual sequences.
LIS is similar to problems involving longest chain of events.
Problems involving envelopes (like Russian Doll Envelopes) are LIS variants.
LIS can be solved offline or online depending on how the input arrives.
Online LIS requires data structures like segment trees or binary indexed trees.
The problem can be extended to find LIS in circular arrays.
Circular LIS needs careful handling of wrap-around comparisons.
In LIS, the original input order must be preserved.
LIS also helps in identifying stability in input patterns.
Real-time systems can use LIS to detect sustained improvement trends.
LIS is foundational in combinatorial optimization.
Solving LIS builds understanding of greedy and DP hybrid solutions.
Mastering LIS helps solve advanced algorithmic challenges.
