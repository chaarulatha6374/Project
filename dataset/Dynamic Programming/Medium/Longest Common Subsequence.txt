The Longest Common Subsequence problem finds the maximum-length subsequence present in both strings using a Dynamic Programming Grid.
The solution is built by comparing characters of both strings and storing results in a DP grid.
Each cell in the DP grid represents the LCS length of prefixes of the two strings.
The value in cell (i, j) of the DP grid is calculated based on whether characters at (i−1) and (j−1) match.
If characters match, the value comes from the diagonal cell plus one in the DP grid.
If they don't match, we take the max from the left or top cell in the DP grid.
The first row and column of the DP grid are filled with zeros, representing empty substrings.
The final LCS length is found at the bottom-right cell of the DP grid.
The DP grid allows solving LCS in O(m×n) time.
The space complexity of the DP grid approach is also O(m×n), but can be optimized.
The DP grid structure provides a tabular view of overlapping subproblems.
The LCS problem satisfies the optimal substructure property in the DP grid.
The problem also has overlapping subproblems, handled efficiently by the DP grid.
The LCS problem can also be modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where each node is a subproblem.
In the DAG, each node (i, j) branches to (i+1, j), (i, j+1), or (i+1, j+1) depending on the characters.
The DAG only moves forward, ensuring it's acyclic.
The DAG model helps in understanding the recursion tree of the problem.
The recursive solution explores all paths in the DAG, but without memoization it’s inefficient.
Memoization adds memory to store previously computed nodes in the DAG.
This converts the exponential recursive DAG into a polynomial solution.
Each match in the strings leads to a diagonal move in the DP grid or down-right in the DAG.
The DP grid captures the longest path through all matching characters.
The DAG reflects how different character combinations affect the result.
The top-down recursive solution over the DAG mimics DFS traversal.
The bottom-up tabulation in the DP grid is iterative and systematic.
To construct the actual LCS string, backtracking is used on the DP grid.
During backtracking in the DP grid, diagonal movement indicates inclusion of a character.
If moving up or left in the DP grid, the current characters are excluded from LCS.
The same backtracking logic can be applied on the DAG by following maximum-valued paths.
The DAG structure helps visualize recursive calls and dependencies.
The DP grid is deterministic, with each cell computed only once.
The DAG has redundant paths unless memoization is used.
For large strings, iterative DP grid is more memory-safe than recursive DAG.
In competitive coding, the DP grid method is commonly preferred.
Space optimization of the DP grid can reduce memory from O(m×n) to O(n).
This is done by keeping only two rows at a time in the DP grid.
The LCS problem is frequently used in file comparison tools using the DP grid.
The DAG model can be expanded to explore all possible LCS sequences.
The number of distinct LCSs can be found by traversing the DAG and collecting all valid paths.
The DP grid only gives one LCS unless explicitly modified.
LCS is different from Longest Common Substring, which needs continuous characters in the DP grid.
Substring problems use a different grid structure where mismatches reset values to zero.
In contrast, LCS values continue to grow across the DP grid despite mismatches.
The DAG version of LCS keeps branching unless restricted by memoization.
The DP grid uses previous values in top, left, or diagonal positions for transitions.
LCS length never decreases as we move right or down in the DP grid.
The DAG is a tree-like expansion of all subproblem branches.
Depth of the DAG is equal to the sum of string lengths in the worst case.
Traversing the DAG shows how choices at each index affect the solution.
The DP grid prevents redundant traversals by storing and reusing results.
The DAG shows that multiple paths can lead to the same (i, j) subproblem.
Top-down memoization uses a table that mirrors the DP grid.
Both DP grid and DAG methods require defining a base case for zero-length prefixes.
Without memoization, the DAG approach performs many overlapping calls.
The DP grid approach processes all subproblems in order.
Each cell in the DP grid captures the optimal solution for its subproblem.
The number of subproblems is m×n, where m and n are string lengths.
These subproblems are visualized as nodes in a DAG.
The DP grid handles dependencies using a bottom-up fill strategy.
The DAG handles dependencies by resolving recursive calls.
The order of strings doesn't change the LCS length in the DP grid.
But the path taken in the DAG may differ due to branching order.
The DP grid structure helps design variants like printing all LCSs.
The DAG structure enables extension into graph search problems.
The DP grid implementation is preferred for its space-time tradeoff.
The DAG is conceptually useful for teaching problem decomposition.
Constructing the LCS string from the DP grid involves careful tracking of moves.
The DAG variant requires storing sequences along with node values.
LCS helps in computing string similarity using the DP grid.
The DAG helps understand the branching factor of recursive algorithms.
The LCS problem can be extended to three strings using a 3D DP grid.
This adds another dimension to the dynamic programming table.
The DAG for three strings becomes more complex due to added choices.
For such problems, the DP grid is much easier to implement and debug.
In real-world applications, the DP grid is more practical for performance.
The DAG can be used for analyzing time complexity visually.
The DP grid is well-suited for iterative, bottom-up implementations.
The DAG is better suited for understanding top-down recursive structures.
The LCS problem is a fundamental example in dynamic programming using DP grids.
It is also a core problem to illustrate recursion graphs using a DAG.
