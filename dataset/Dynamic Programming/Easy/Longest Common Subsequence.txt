LCS finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences.
The LCS problem uses a dynamic programming grid to store intermediate results.
Each cell in the dynamic programming grid represents a subproblem based on prefixes of two strings.
The grid is filled row by row from top-left to bottom-right.
The dynamic programming grid helps avoid recalculating the same subproblems.
LCS is not about contiguous characters but about ordered matching.
Each cell (i, j) in the grid compares characters from string1[i-1] and string2[j-1].
If characters match, we move diagonally in the grid and add one to the LCS count.
If characters don’t match, we take the maximum from the left or top cell in the grid.
The grid’s size is (m+1) x (n+1), where m and n are lengths of the two strings.
The base case in the grid initializes the first row and column to zero.
The final answer lies at the bottom-right corner of the dynamic programming grid.
LCS can also be visualized as a DAG, where each node represents a subproblem (i, j).
In the DAG, each node points to its next possible subproblems.
A path through the DAG represents a choice of including or excluding characters.
The DAG is acyclic because we only move right, down, or diagonally.
Memoization stores the results of each (i, j) node in the DAG to avoid recomputation.
The length of the LCS is the maximum path length through the DAG where characters match.
In the grid, a matching character leads to a diagonal increment.
In the DAG, matching characters form the nodes contributing to the LCS.
A mismatch results in choosing between top or left in the grid.
The DAG branches based on character matches or mismatches.
LCS is useful in comparing files and DNA sequences.
The grid helps track all possible common subsequences efficiently.
The DAG avoids recomputation by reusing overlapping subproblems.
Recursive LCS without memoization leads to exponential time.
Using a grid, we reduce the time complexity to O(m*n).
The DAG model allows visualizing the subproblem dependencies.
Backtracking from the bottom-right cell in the grid gives the actual LCS string.
We move diagonally while backtracking if characters match in the grid.
If they don’t match, we move to the cell with the greater value in the grid.
The DAG backtrack also follows maximum-valued paths to trace the LCS.
The grid approach is deterministic and guarantees optimal results.
The DAG has a topological order since it’s acyclic.
Space complexity can be reduced using only two rows of the grid.
This optimization comes from the observation that only the previous row is needed in the grid.
LCS is different from Longest Common Substring.
Substring requires continuous matches; grid for substring resets on mismatches.
The DAG model for substring differs due to contiguous constraints.
LCS in grid doesn’t reset on mismatch; it builds over multiple positions.
LCS supports both bottom-up and top-down approaches using the grid or DAG.
In bottom-up, the grid is filled by iterating through both strings.
In top-down, the DAG is recursively traversed with memoization.
The grid solution has better iterative control and predictable memory usage.
The DAG recursion is easier to code but can risk stack overflow without memoization.
Every move in the grid or DAG reflects a decision in the subproblem.
LCS helps in measuring similarity between texts.
The structure of the grid is like a table of all subproblem answers.
The DAG is a tree-like structure of all possible match combinations.
Every subproblem is solved once in the grid method.
The DAG has nodes equal to the number of unique (i, j) pairs.
LCS has optimal substructure — smaller problems combine into larger ones.
This is evident in how the grid is filled using smaller cell values.
The DAG shows this through node dependencies in recursive calls.
The grid technique leads to clear and structured tabulation.
The DAG visual shows flow of recursive function calls.
The length of the LCS is independent of string order in the grid.
But the order affects the actual common subsequence.
The grid must be rebuilt for each unique string pair.
The DAG is different for different string lengths and contents.
In the grid, LCS length increases only on character match.
The DAG encodes this condition in its transition rules.
The problem is solved in polynomial time using dynamic programming grid.
The recursive DAG version without memoization is exponential.
The grid version is preferred for its time and space efficiency.
The DAG helps understand recursion depth and branching.
Dynamic programming transforms recursive DAG into efficient grid form.
Overlapping subproblems are managed well in the grid.
LCS is a classic problem to introduce the concept of grids in dynamic programming.
LCS can be modified to find multiple subsequences using the same grid.
Both grid and DAG ensure correctness if subproblem logic is accurate.
Base cases in the grid are important for proper initialization.
In the DAG, base cases terminate the recursion.
The dimensions of the grid are directly proportional to input sizes.
The number of nodes in the DAG is the product of string lengths.
LCS length is useful in edit distance calculation.
The grid can be extended to show actual characters of LCS.
The DAG structure helps in understanding LCS variants like printing all LCSs.
LCS is a building block for many diff tools and bioinformatics apps.
Understanding the grid or DAG approach is essential for mastering dynamic programming.
