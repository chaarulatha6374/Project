LIS is the longest subsequence where elements increase.
A subsequence can skip elements but keeps order.
All elements in the LIS must be in increasing order.
The LIS must be as long as possible.
Each number is compared with earlier numbers.
If a number is larger, it can extend the sequence.
Start by storing 1 for each position.
One element alone is an increasing subsequence.
Compare each element with all before it.
If it’s greater, update the maximum length.
Track the longest length found so far.
Use an array to store lengths of sequences.
The answer is the maximum in this array.
The order of numbers is important.
You cannot rearrange the input.
Duplicate numbers do not increase the LIS.
A single repeating number gives LIS of 1.
A sorted array has LIS equal to its length.
A reverse sorted array has LIS of 1.
You can use nested loops to find LIS.
Every number has a chance to start a new sequence.
You compare current number with previous ones.
Only increasing numbers help build LIS.
Store the best possible LIS at each index.
Continue updating this while going through the array.
The final answer is the biggest stored value.
The array may contain negative numbers.
The logic remains the same for negatives.
You can track the actual sequence too.
Store the index of previous elements to rebuild it.
LIS has optimal substructure property.
LIS also has overlapping subproblems.
Dynamic programming is a good way to solve it.
Time complexity using dynamic programming is O(n²).
There is also a better method using binary search.
The binary search method runs in O(n log n).
You build a new list to store increasing numbers.
Replace larger numbers to keep the list increasing.
That list does not give the exact sequence.
But its length gives the LIS length.
LIS can be applied to strings as well.
Convert letters to ASCII to compare them.
LIS is useful in data analysis.
It can find trends in stock prices.
It can show student progress over time.
LIS is used in version control systems.
It helps compare differences in files.
LIS can help in patience sorting.
Patience sorting is a card game technique.
LIS has real-world importance in machine learning.
LIS can be solved using recursion.
But recursion without memory is slow.
Memoization speeds up the recursion.
Dynamic programming avoids repeated work.
Space optimization can reduce memory usage.
1D arrays are enough to store LIS lengths.
Binary search is applied on the helper list.
Lower bound finds where to replace elements.
It ensures the list remains increasing.
Replacement does not affect final length.
You can find the number of LIS too.
Count how many ways each length appears.
Use an extra array for counting.
Update counts when lengths match.
Combine counts for equal-length paths.
The LIS may have many valid answers.
The LIS must always preserve input order.
Random access helps in implementation.
LIS can be visualized using graphs.
LIS length is always between 1 and n.
If all elements are the same, LIS is 1.
LIS does not allow decreasing numbers.
Even if one number decreases, it breaks the LIS.
Two LIS of same length can start at different points.
Elements skipped in LIS can be any value.
But skipped values must not affect the order.
The problem is a classic in dynamic programming.
LIS is often asked in coding interviews.
Practicing LIS helps improve problem-solving skills.
Understanding LIS helps in other sequence problems.
