The Knapsack Problem can be modeled as a DAG where each node represents a state of item index and capacity.
In this DAG, each node connects to the next state with or without including the current item.
The graph is directed because transitions go only forward from one item to the next.
It is acyclic because no state loops back to a previous item or capacity in the DAG.
Each path in the DAG represents a sequence of decisions for including or skipping items.
The DAG starts at the initial state where no item is considered and the knapsack is empty.
Edges in the DAG represent decisions like “include the item” or “exclude the item.”
Each state in the DAG is defined by the current item index and remaining capacity.
The DAG ensures that each transition leads to a valid subproblem.
Each decision adds a directed edge in the DAG to a new state.
The base case in the DAG is the state with no items or zero capacity.
Leaf nodes in the DAG represent complete decision paths.
The goal is to find the path in the DAG that gives the maximum total value.
A node in the DAG stores the best value that can be obtained from that state.
In 0/1 Knapsack, each item is considered only once, forming a layered DAG.
The number of layers in the DAG equals the number of items.
Within each layer of the DAG, different capacities form separate nodes.
The DAG grows with both the number of items and the maximum capacity.
Skipping an item means moving to the next layer in the DAG with the same capacity.
Including an item moves to the next layer with reduced capacity in the DAG.
The structure of the DAG allows dynamic programming to reuse previously computed results.
Each node in the DAG gets its value from the maximum of its two incoming transitions.
A top-down recursive solution navigates the DAG from the root to leaves.
A bottom-up DP table traverses the DAG from leaves to the root.
The solution is stored at the root node of the DAG that represents the full problem.
Memoization in the top-down approach avoids re-visiting the same DAG nodes.
Bottom-up DP fills the DAG layer by layer for all capacities.
The 2D DP table corresponds to a matrix view of the DAG.
In the 0/1 version, the DAG has two outgoing edges per item: take or skip.
The total number of nodes in the DAG is proportional to items times capacity.
The DAG does not contain cycles because no node points back to a previous state.
The edges in the DAG represent possible moves in the decision space.
Each path in the DAG represents a different subset of selected items.
Nodes in the DAG accumulate values based on selected items’ weights and profits.
In fractional knapsack, graph structure is not used, but 0/1 knapsack uses a DAG.
The DAG allows tracking decisions that lead to the maximum value.
Backtracking the DAG from the final node shows which items are selected.
In the bounded knapsack, each item may be selected multiple times, changing the DAG structure.
Unbounded knapsack creates a DAG where nodes loop forward within the same item index.
The unbounded DAG has more edges due to repeated item usage.
The DAG helps visualize all subproblems in the knapsack.
Each state in the DAG is unique and represents a precise subproblem.
No state in the DAG depends on a future item, keeping it acyclic.
Optimal substructure is visible in the DAG as best solutions come from smaller problems.
Each node in the DAG is connected only to the next item index.
The maximum value path in the DAG represents the best item combination.
The final answer is found at the starting node after solving the whole DAG.
Overlapping subproblems are seen in the DAG when multiple paths reach the same state.
The graph size can be reduced using space optimization in the DAG.
The DAG is highly structured, making dynamic programming efficient.
The greedy approach does not apply to the 0/1 DAG.
The weight constraint restricts edge movement in the DAG.
Each transition in the DAG checks whether the item can be added based on weight.
Edges in the DAG do not carry weights but represent a choice.
The value is stored at nodes, not along edges, in the DAG.
A BFS traversal of the DAG is inefficient due to state explosion.
The DP table is the most efficient way to represent the DAG.
Each state only depends on the previous layer in the DAG.
In unbounded knapsack, some states in the DAG may be revisited through different paths.
Repetition of subproblems is minimized using memoization in the DAG.
Edge pruning in the DAG is done when capacity is exceeded.
The DAG encodes all feasible decisions in the problem.
The DAG ensures decisions are ordered and constraints are respected.
The solution trace in the DAG shows the included items.
The DAG starts with zero capacity and no items used.
The DAG terminates at all possible final states after all items.
The best among all final states gives the optimal solution in the DAG.
The DAG is flattened into a table for iterative solutions.
The recursive tree can be converted into a DAG using memoization.
This transition from tree to DAG avoids recomputation.
Visualizing the DAG helps understand item choices.
Every node in the DAG has only two parents in the 0/1 version.
The DAG allows analyzing trade-offs between value and weight.
Value accumulation happens only at nodes in the DAG.
Skipping the item leads to horizontal movement in the DAG.
Including the item causes a vertical and diagonal move in the DAG.
The DAG captures complete solution space for the problem.
Space-optimized DP reduces the DAG to one row.
The structure of the DAG allows time complexity of O(nW).
Solving the Knapsack Problem is about efficiently traversing the DAG of choices.
