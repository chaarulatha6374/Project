The 0/1 Knapsack Problem can be modeled using a DAG, where nodes represent states parameterized by item index and current capacity.
Each directed edge in this DAG models a decision transition from one subproblem to the next.
The DAG has no cycles because decisions only move forward through the list of items.
A complete solution path in the DAG maps to a specific sequence of inclusion/exclusion choices.
Nodes in the DAG are structured as (i, w) where i is the item index and w is remaining capacity.
The acyclic nature of the DAG ensures that no state is revisited from itself or a future state.
In the DAG, every decision to include or exclude an item leads to a directed transition to a lower-indexed or lower-capacity node.
Edge weights are not used since cost accumulation happens at nodes, not along edges, in the DAG.
Dynamic programming optimizes traversal of the DAG by caching results at each node.
Top-down memoization prevents re-evaluation of the same DAG node during recursive calls.
Bottom-up tabulation simulates a complete traversal of the DAG, filling values from leaves to root.
The source node in the DAG corresponds to the initial state (0 items, full capacity).
The sink nodes of the DAG are states where all items have been considered, regardless of capacity.
An optimal solution is equivalent to the maximum value obtained at any terminal node in the DAG.
Inclusion decisions in the DAG are made only if item weight does not exceed residual capacity.
In the DAG, each node (i, w) has at most two incoming edges — one from including and one from excluding the previous item.
The recurrence relation f(i, w) = max(f(i-1, w), f(i-1, w - wt[i]) + val[i]) is a DAG traversal formula.
The recurrence is executed over the DAG's nodes by either dynamic recursion or iterative filling.
Redundant paths in the DAG are avoided through memoization, collapsing exponential states into a DAG.
The DAG compresses a brute-force recursion tree by recognizing shared substructures.
In a complete traversal, each node in the DAG is evaluated exactly once, yielding a polynomial runtime.
In unbounded knapsack, the DAG differs by allowing self-edges at nodes to represent repeated item usage.
The unbounded version introduces cycles if treated naively, but a carefully ordered DAG can maintain acyclicity.
The dimension of the DAG is O(n * W), where n is item count and W is the total capacity.
State (i, w) in the DAG depends only on states (i-1, w) and (i-1, w-wt[i]) — its predecessors.
The 2D DP table is an implicit adjacency list representation of the DAG.
All decision paths in the DAG lead to a unique solution path corresponding to maximum profit.
Tracing back from the final node in the DAG reveals the specific item choices made.
Unlike greedy methods, the DAG explicitly considers all feasible combinations of items.
The DAG supports backtracking analysis to retrieve the optimal subset of items.
Each node in the DAG contributes to the solution if its value is part of the optimal path.
The presence of overlapping subproblems is visualized as converging paths in the DAG.
Memoization resolves these overlaps by storing values directly at the DAG nodes.
A well-constructed DAG prunes unnecessary subproblems by applying constraints during traversal.
The entire decision space of the knapsack is encoded in the topology of the DAG.
The DAG starts with all capacity and no decisions and ends at terminal states with no items left.
Every edge in the DAG corresponds to a binary decision step (include or exclude).
In practice, the DAG is implemented implicitly using a table or recursive stack.
The time complexity of solving the DAG is proportional to the number of nodes.
Memory optimization is achievable by compressing the DAG vertically or horizontally using rolling arrays.
The 1D space optimization technique is justified by observing dependencies in the DAG are only to the previous row.
The DAG structure ensures no recomputation, unlike naive recursion which would form an exponential tree.
For fractional knapsack, a DAG is not necessary due to the greedy nature of the solution.
The DAG structure assumes items are indivisible and order of evaluation impacts intermediate states.
Generalized knapsack extensions (e.g., multi-dimensional, bounded) also follow a DAG model with added dimensions.
Decision forests for grouped knapsack items form a union of DAGs connected by dependency constraints.
The hard case of large weights and small values leads to deeper DAG levels for optimal decision-making.
Edge elimination based on infeasibility is a form of DAG pruning.
A node (i, w) in the DAG is invalid if w < 0 or i < 0 and is omitted from traversal.
The longest weighted path in the DAG corresponds to the maximum value configuration.
The DAG's topology inherently enforces capacity and item index monotonicity.
Using a priority queue isn't helpful since the DAG doesn't involve weighted edges.
An iterative post-order traversal of the DAG fills optimal values bottom-up.
Reducing state dimensions (e.g., capacity modulo) shrinks the size of the DAG while preserving correctness.
Complexity analysis becomes clearer when visualizing the DAG as a grid.
The DAG facilitates derivation of recurrence relations used for algorithm optimization.
Nodes with no outgoing edges in the DAG represent dead ends or constrained paths.
In variant problems, the DAG may include constraints like mutual exclusivity or ordering.
Bounding techniques such as branch-and-bound operate on a tree derived from the same DAG.
Approximate solutions (e.g., FPTAS) work by coarsening the node values in the DAG.
The DAG structure enforces a clean topological order based on increasing item indices.
The topological ordering simplifies transition logic in iterative implementations.
Unlike Dijkstra’s or Bellman-Ford, the DAG in knapsack lacks explicit edge weights.
The DAG's acyclic property guarantees convergence in finite time.
The state compression technique of storing only active rows is justified by the linear predecessor rule in the DAG.
The DAG supports analytical modeling of time-space tradeoffs in dynamic programming.
Recursive tree traversal without memoization leads to exponential complexity and breaks the DAG structure.
Optimality in the DAG arises from Bellman's principle of optimality across all nodes.
Visualization of the DAG reveals symmetry between different paths leading to same capacity.
The number of feasible paths in the DAG grows exponentially but is compressed through DP.
Each DAG node holds the maximal cumulative value from all reachable sub-paths.
The complete set of subproblems in knapsack is isomorphic to nodes in the DAG.
Dynamic programming is a traversal strategy over the DAG ensuring reuse and minimal recomputation.
Backpropagation through the DAG nodes is used to extract decision traces.
The order of filling the DAG directly affects algorithm correctness.
In the DAG, capacity transitions are irreversible, reflecting the diminishing nature of resources.
Solving the DAG involves strategic evaluation to avoid exponential exploration.
Practical implementation avoids explicitly storing the DAG, leveraging DP tables instead.
The structure and traversal order of the DAG influence both correctness and performance.
The DAG forms the theoretical foundation underlying all dynamic programming formulations of the Knapsack Problem.
