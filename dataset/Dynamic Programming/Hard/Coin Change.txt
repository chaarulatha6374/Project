The Coin Change problem can be modeled as a shortest path problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where each node represents an achievable amount.
In this DAG, nodes from 0 to amount represent states, and directed edges simulate coin transitions.
A node u in the DAG connects to v = u + c for each coin c, forming forward-only edges.
This graph remains acyclic due to strictly increasing transitions, a property inherent to the DAG structure.
Each coin denomination contributes to multiple outgoing edges from every reachable node in the DAG.
The graph starts from the source node 0, which has zero cost and is the root of the DAG.
Transitions between nodes in the DAG reflect state transformations via addition of coin denominations.
Since the state transition never revisits lower nodes, cycles are inherently avoided in this DAG.
Each edge in the DAG represents a constant-weight operation of adding a coin’s value.
The solution to Coin Change corresponds to the shortest path from node 0 to amount in this DAG.
Top-down DP with memoization implicitly traverses this DAG via recursive backward edges.
Bottom-up DP explicitly simulates BFS over this DAG by iterating through increasing amounts.
The DAG structure guarantees well-ordered dependency resolution since each state depends only on smaller states.
Every state in the DAG aggregates optimal transitions from its predecessors, forming optimal substructures.
The recurrence relation mimics dynamic traversal through the DAG, exploring all viable paths.
Edge relaxation in the DAG involves updating the state cost based on incoming transitions.
Since all edge weights are uniform, this DAG does not require priority queues like in Dijkstra’s.
The in-degree of each node in the DAG equals the number of coins that can form it.
If no coins can reach a node, that node in the DAG remains disconnected and marked unreachable.
Path enumeration in the DAG corresponds to counting the number of valid coin combinations.
A topological sort of the DAG aligns with increasing amount values in bottom-up DP.
Reverse transitions in a top-down approach follow edges from amount to amount - coin, within the same DAG.
The Coin Change graph can also be seen as a leveled DAG where each level represents a step count.
In the coin permutation variant, the DAG becomes more densely connected, allowing more distinct paths to each node.
For counting solutions, node values in the DAG store the number of incoming paths.
This creates a distinction in the DAG between optimization-based traversal and enumeration-based traversal.
Coin constraints such as bounded usage restrict edge multiplicity in the DAG.
The DAG expansion factor is directly proportional to the number of coins and their relative values.
Using BFS on the DAG, each state can be visited once with early stopping on reaching amount.
Early pruning in the DAG removes transitions that lead to out-of-bound values or exceed the amount.
Each node i in the DAG has transitions to i + c for all c in coins where i + c <= amount.
The uniform cost of edges allows the DAG to be processed layer-by-layer without needing dynamic reordering.
If state i is unreachable, then the node i in the DAG has no predecessors and should hold infinity.
A zero-initialized node in the DAG implies base case satisfaction, such as amount 0.
The problem assumes that coins can be used infinitely, so the DAG has repeated self-originating transitions.
Cycles are impossible in this DAG due to monotonically increasing state transitions.
The DAG effectively spans all reachable states from the initial node using valid transitions.
The optimal number of coins for a given amount is the shortest path length to that node in the DAG.
If backtracking is needed, we can annotate edges in the DAG with the coin used to reach each node.
The edge list of this DAG can be compressed using a 1D array and modulo operations for optimization.
All state transitions are deterministic and constant time per coin in the DAG.
For dense coin sets, the DAG becomes dense with edge count proportional to amount * coins.length.
Sparse coin sets lead to a DAG with limited transitions and lower memory overhead.
Traversal in the DAG stops naturally once the amount node is reached or all transitions are exhausted.
Traceability in the DAG helps recover actual coin combinations that construct the optimal solution.
In the weighted coin variant, each edge in the DAG carries an associated cost beyond uniform transitions.
The transition cost could be weighted by physical coin constraints or denomination priorities in the DAG.
Enumeration of paths in the DAG must account for overlapping subpaths using memoization.
In combination mode, the outer loop over coins ensures the DAG is processed in coin-order hierarchy.
In permutation mode, the inner loop over coins yields all sequence variants for the DAG transitions.
Every node update in the DAG represents a DP state re-evaluation based on recent transitions.
For large target amounts, efficient construction of the DAG ensures polynomial time complexity.
The DAG approach fits into the class of single-source unweighted reachability problems.
The number of distinct paths to a node in the DAG equals the number of ways to form that amount.
Pruning unreachable states early reduces the effective size of the DAG significantly.
Since the DAG has only forward transitions, topological ordering is trivially defined.
Reverse DP on the DAG is useful in reconstructing paths or handling bounded coin use.
Each node’s final value in the DAG results from a min-reduce or sum-reduce over predecessor paths.
Memoization acts as a cache over the DAG traversal to prevent exponential recomputation.
Visualization of the DAG exposes patterns in coin dependencies and amount gaps.
For coins with GCD > 1, some nodes in the DAG remain permanently unreachable.
Edge failures in the DAG highlight infeasible subproblems due to incompatible coin denominations.
DP table updates correspond directly to edge relaxations in the DAG.
Dynamic programming is merely a means of performing shortest path computations over this DAG.
Since the DAG is acyclic, all computations are guaranteed to terminate.
Space optimization techniques leverage the linear structure of the DAG to reuse memory efficiently.
Redundant updates in the DAG are avoided through pre-checks on DP values.
A BFS over the DAG from node 0 yields the minimal steps required to form any amount.
In a modified DAG, edge weights can vary based on contextual penalties or rewards.
Multi-source BFS is possible if we begin from all coin values directly in the DAG.
Dynamic programming solutions form an implicit traversal of the DAG without materializing edges.
The node amount may be unreachable in the DAG if the coin set has gaps in coverage.
The acyclic nature of the DAG means we never need cycle detection or infinite loop guards.
The DAG can be unrolled into a table, but the underlying graph semantics persist.
Every entry in the DP table corresponds to a node in the DAG with an associated cost.
Early stopping in BFS or DP helps terminate traversal of the DAG once the goal is met.
Backward traversal of the DAG can yield all possible coin paths by recursively unwinding transitions.
The shortest path tree over the DAG reveals the most efficient construction sequence for any state.
The mathematical properties of the DAG enable strong guarantees on correctness and completeness.
This makes Coin Change one of the canonical problems demonstrating DAG-based dynamic programming formulations.
