Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) is the problem of determining the maximal-length subsequence in which every subsequent element is strictly greater than its predecessor.
Unlike substrings, LIS deals with non-contiguous subsequences preserving relative order.
The problem exhibits optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, making it suitable for dynamic programming.
For every element in the sequence, we must assess the LIS terminating at that index by scanning all previous valid LIS extensions.
Define dp[i] as the length of LIS ending at index i; initialize all dp[i] = 1.
For each i, we check every j < i and update dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1) if arr[i] > arr[j].
The final LIS is max(dp[i]) over all i.
This brute-force DP approach has O(n²) time complexity and O(n) space.
An optimized method employs patience sorting combined with binary search to reach O(n log n) complexity.
Maintain a tails array where tails[i] stores the minimum possible tail value of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.
The tails array does not hold the actual LIS, but its length equals the LIS length.
Elements in tails are updated using binary search for efficiency, maintaining minimal tail values.
This greedy approach ensures the longest subsequence grows with optimal tail values, preserving correctness.
To reconstruct the LIS in O(n log n), one must store predecessor indices while updating tails.
The LIS problem can be mapped to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where edges exist from smaller to larger values with increasing indices.
In this DAG representation, the LIS corresponds to the longest path in the DAG.
Unlike general longest path problems, the DAG derived from arrays has special properties enabling polynomial-time solutions.
LIS is used in solving the problem of minimum deletions to make a sequence sorted.
It is also applied in solving longest chain problems and scheduling tasks with ordering constraints.
The number of distinct LIS paths can be computed by augmenting the DP with a count array tracking possible LIS combinations.
Each time a longer LIS is found, the count is reset; if an equal-length LIS is found, the count is incremented.
LIS can be generalized to finding the longest path in a partially ordered set.
LIS length equals the minimal number of strictly increasing sequences required to partition the array.
Inverse LIS represents the longest non-increasing subsequence, forming a dual problem.
The longest bitonic subsequence (increasing then decreasing) uses two LIS computations — forward and backward.
LIS is a foundational building block in multivariate dynamic programming problems.
LIS can be solved online with segment trees or Binary Indexed Trees when data arrives incrementally.
When applied to string sequences, LIS helps in computing common structure between character arrays.
LIS length forms a lower bound for the edit distance between two sequences when alignment is required.
The patience sorting algorithm used in card games is a physical simulation of the LIS computation.
In the patience sorting analogy, each new number is placed on the leftmost pile with a greater top card or creates a new pile.
The number of piles equals the LIS length; cards at top of each pile simulate the tails array.
In two-dimensional LIS problems, values are first sorted by one dimension and LIS is computed over the other.
LIS is used to solve the "Russian Doll Envelope" problem where each envelope must fit into a larger one.
LIS length is invariant under monotonic transformations that preserve ordering.
Variants of LIS include enforcing constraints such as maximum gap between adjacent values.
For LIS with a maximum allowed difference d between adjacent elements, DP recurrence requires conditional checks on value differences.

In compiler design, LIS is used in instruction scheduling for loop optimization.
LIS also arises in bioinformatics, particularly in sequence alignment and genome rearrangement problems.
LIS can be derived from Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) if one of the sequences is sorted.
Mapping LIS to LCS allows leveraging matrix-based methods, though it’s suboptimal in time complexity.
The reconstruction of the actual LIS requires backtracking using a parent array storing previous indices in the optimal path.
For efficient backtracking in O(n log n), one must maintain index mappings along with value insertions.
The LIS of a sequence is not necessarily unique; multiple subsequences of the same length can exist.
To enumerate all LIS sequences, one must perform a breadth-first traversal using previously computed LIS lengths.
When all elements are the same, the LIS is trivially of length 1.
When the array is sorted in increasing order, LIS length equals array length.
When strictly decreasing, the LIS length is always 1.
LIS is monotonic under array extension only if the new element is larger than all previous values.
