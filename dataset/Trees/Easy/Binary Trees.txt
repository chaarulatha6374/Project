A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children.
A binary tree consists of a root node, left subtree, and right subtree.
In a binary tree, each node can have zero, one, or two children.
A complete binary tree is filled from left to right without gaps.
A full binary tree is one where every node has either 0 or 2 children.
A perfect binary tree is both full and complete.
The root node is the topmost node in a binary tree.
The height of a binary tree is the number of edges on the longest path from root to a leaf.
A leaf node in a binary tree has no children.
Internal nodes in a binary tree have at least one child.
In a balanced binary tree, the height difference between left and right subtrees is minimal.
Binary trees are used to represent hierarchical data.
Binary trees can be traversed in inorder, preorder, and postorder.
In inorder traversal of a binary tree, the left node is visited before the root and then the right node.
Preorder traversal of a binary tree visits the root first, then the left, then the right subtree.
Postorder traversal of a binary tree visits left and right children before the root.
Binary trees are often used in expression evaluation.
In a binary tree, each edge connects a parent to its child.
A binary tree with only left children forms a linear structure like a linked list.
A binary tree with only right children also looks like a list.
Binary trees are recursive in nature.
Each node in a binary tree stores data and pointers to its children.
A degenerate binary tree is where each parent has only one child.
Binary trees can be used to store sorted data for quick search.
Binary trees support insertion and deletion operations.
In a full binary tree, the total number of leaf nodes is always one more than the internal nodes.
A binary tree can be implemented using classes or structures.
The number of nodes in a perfect binary tree is 2^h - 1, where h is the height.
A perfect binary tree has all leaves at the same level.
In a complete binary tree, the last level may not be full.
Binary trees can be represented using arrays.
