A binary tree is a hierarchical structure where each node has at most two child nodes, referred to as the left and right children.
The structure of a binary tree is recursively defined, with each subtree itself being a binary tree.
A complete binary tree maintains all levels fully filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
In a full binary tree, every non-leaf node strictly has two children.
A perfect binary tree is both full and complete, with all leaves at the same depth and all internal nodes having two children.
The root of a binary tree is the topmost node and serves as the entry point to the structure.
The height of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path from the root to any leaf node.
A leaf node in a binary tree has no children and represents the termination of a path.
Internal nodes in a binary tree are those which have at least one child, distinguishing them from leaves.
A balanced binary tree ensures that the height difference between the left and right subtrees is minimal to maintain efficiency.
Traversal in binary trees includes inorder (left-root-right), preorder (root-left-right), and postorder (left-right-root).
In a binary tree, inorder traversal is particularly useful for retrieving sorted data from a binary search tree.
Preorder traversal in binary trees is used to clone trees or create prefix notation expressions.
Postorder traversal is helpful in deleting trees or evaluating postfix expressions.
Binary trees allow efficient organization and retrieval of hierarchical information.
A binary tree node typically contains data and pointers to its left and right child nodes.
A degenerate binary tree degenerates into a linear list due to having only one child at each node.
Expression trees, which are binary trees, are used to represent arithmetic expressions.
A skewed binary tree has nodes extending only to the left or only to the right, depending on insertion order.
The depth of a node in a binary tree refers to the number of edges from the root to that node.
Binary trees can be stored either as linked structures or using array-based representations.
In a complete binary tree, children of the node at index i in an array representation are at indices 2i+1 and 2i+2.
Full binary trees contain the maximum number of nodes for their height under the full tree definition.
A perfect binary tree of height h contains exactly 2^h - 1 nodes.
A balanced binary tree minimizes height and keeps operations close to O(log n).
Binary trees are inherently recursive in structure, which simplifies many algorithms.
Trees with height imbalance perform poorly in time-critical applications.
Binary trees are widely used in recursive algorithm problems.
Level-order traversal in binary trees uses a queue to visit nodes level by level.
Binary trees can model hierarchical data such as file systems or organizational charts.
Binary trees play a crucial role in implementing efficient searching and sorting mechanisms.
Binary trees are used as a foundation for self-balancing trees like AVL and Red-Black Trees.
A complete binary tree ensures efficient memory use and is typically used in heaps.
Binary trees can be built from inorder and preorder or inorder and postorder traversal arrays.
The number of null pointers in a binary tree is always one more than the number of nodes.
Binary trees are frequently used in the construction of syntax trees in compilers.
An internal path length of a binary tree is the sum of depths of all internal nodes.
The external path length includes the depths of all external (leaf) nodes.
A binary tree can be traversed non-recursively using an explicit stack or queue.
The mirror image of a binary tree is produced by swapping left and right subtrees recursively.
Binary trees support ancestor-descendant relationships between nodes.
The lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree can be found using recursion.
Binary trees enable divide and conquer algorithms by breaking problems into subtrees.
Binary trees support insertion, deletion, and search operations based on tree type.
The time complexity for tree traversal in a binary tree is O(n).
A complete binary tree has minimal height for a given number of nodes.
Binary trees are used in Huffman coding for lossless data compression.
Balanced binary trees provide guaranteed performance for inserts and lookups.
Binary trees can be serialized into a string representation and later deserialized.
Binary trees are a precursor to binary search trees, where node values follow a specific order.
Binary trees can be implemented using pointer-based or index-based systems.
Binary trees allow efficient modeling of hierarchical menus or forms.
Heaps, implemented as complete binary trees, support efficient priority queue operations.
Binary trees help represent game trees in decision-making algorithms like minimax.
Tree rotations are not required in regular binary trees but are essential in self-balancing trees.
A binary tree can be constructed from a breadth-first array representation.
Binary trees can have different shapes even with the same set of nodes.
Binary trees are traversed using Depth-First or Breadth-First strategies.
Preorder traversal is useful in prefix notation evaluation.
Postorder traversal simplifies deletion of binary trees.
Inorder traversal gives a sorted sequence in a binary search tree.
