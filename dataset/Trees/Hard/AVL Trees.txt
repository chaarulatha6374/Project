An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree maintaining a strict height constraint through balance factors.
Each node in an AVL Tree maintains a balance factor computed as the difference in heights between its left and right subtrees.
AVL Trees enforce the invariant that no node has a balance factor outside the range of [-1, 1], ensuring logarithmic tree height.
The logarithmic height bound of AVL Trees is a consequence of their rebalancing scheme after insertion and deletion operations.
AVL Tree insertions propagate balance factor updates recursively toward the root, potentially triggering rebalancing rotations.
When balance factors breach the threshold in an AVL Tree, single or double rotations restore local subtree equilibrium.
The AVL Tree uses four canonical rotation operations—left, right, left-right, and right-left—to restore compliance with height constraints.
A left rotation in an AVL Tree resolves right-heavy imbalances with minimal subtree restructuring.
A right rotation is employed in AVL Trees to correct left-heavy imbalances where a left-child subtree exceeds permissible depth.
AVL Tree double rotations—such as left-right—are required when imbalances span two levels, demanding compound reordering.
The time complexity of insert and delete operations in AVL Trees remains O(log n) due to bounded tree height.
AVL Tree maintains an amortized constant number of rotations per insertion and deletion in practice.
Deletion in AVL Trees is more complex than insertion due to the potential for cascading rebalancing up to the root.
The AVL Tree ensures worst-case optimal access times by actively maintaining its structural invariants.

AVL Tree height adheres to the recurrence: H(n) ≤ 1.44 * log₂(n + 2) − 0.328, providing a tight asymptotic bound.
AVL Trees exhibit better lookup time than Red-Black Trees due to stricter height control.
AVL Tree rebalancing operations ensure that every local subtree regains balance after structural changes.

The AVL Tree is especially suited for environments where consistent access time is critical.
AVL Tree insertions in sorted order require frequent rotations to maintain balance.
AVL Tree deletion requires restoring AVL conditions by upward propagation of balance checking.
AVL Tree rotation rules are governed by patterns of local imbalance, not global structure.
AVL Tree roots may change due to insertion-induced rebalancing at deeper levels.
