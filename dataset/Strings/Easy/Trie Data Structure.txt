A Trie is a tree-like data structure.
It is used to store a dynamic set of strings.
Each node in a Trie represents a character.
A path from the root to a node represents a prefix.
Tries are mainly used for efficient retrieval of strings.
They are especially useful for dictionary-related problems.
Each level of a Trie represents one character of a word.
The root node is usually empty or null.
Children of each node store possible next characters.
Trie is also known as a prefix tree.
It can quickly check if a word is present.
It can also find if a prefix exists in the dataset.
Tries are faster than hash maps for prefix matching.
In a Trie, there are no duplicate nodes for common prefixes.
Words with common prefixes share paths in the Trie.
Insertion in Trie is done character by character.
Searching is also done character by character.
Trie nodes usually contain an array or map of children.
Each node may have a flag to mark the end of a word.
This flag is called an end-of-word marker.
Trie supports three basic operations: insert, search, and delete.
Tries are case-sensitive unless modified.
They work best with strings from a known character set.
English alphabet Tries typically use 26 child references per node.
Tries can also handle numbers or Unicode characters.
Tries take more space than hash tables.
But they offer faster search for prefix-based queries.
They are commonly used in autocomplete systems.
Tries can be used for spell checking.
They are also used in IP routing (Longest Prefix Matching).
Tries can answer prefix queries in O(m) time.
Here, m is the length of the word or prefix.
Time complexity of insert and search is also O(m).
Tries can store millions of strings efficiently.
Memory usage depends on word length and branching.
Deletion in Trie requires careful handling of nodes.
Unused nodes should be removed during deletion.
Trie nodes can be represented using linked lists or arrays.
Arrays are faster but take more space.
Maps are space-efficient but slower.
A Trie can be modified to return all words with a given prefix.
This helps in applications like search suggestions.
Tries are not limited to alphabets only.
They can store any kind of string data.
Trie traversal is like tree traversal with strings.
Depth-first traversal helps in listing stored words.
Tries support lexicographical sorting naturally.
Trie avoids hash collisions, unlike hash maps.
Words stored in Tries are automatically sorted by structure.
Tries can be compressed to reduce space.
A compressed Trie is called a Radix Tree or Patricia Trie.
In compressed Tries, chains of single-child nodes are merged.
Tries can be implemented recursively or iteratively.
Recursive implementations are easier to understand.
Iterative ones are more memory-efficient.
Trie-based autocomplete works by traversing to a prefix node.
Then it gathers all words from that node onward.
Tries are commonly used in search engines.
They help speed up keyword lookup.
Tries are used in T9 predictive text systems.
They are also used in word games and puzzles.
Tries can detect prefixes of malicious URLs in security tools.
Tries can store large dictionaries efficiently.
Word suggestions based on prefixes use Trie traversal.
Tries can store words of different lengths easily.
You can count how many words start with a given prefix using Tries.
Tries make prefix counting operations fast.
Tries are excellent for scenarios with large prefix overlap.
They support batch insertions of strings.
Tries provide a good balance of time and space in many use cases.
Tries allow efficient wildcard searching in some cases.
With small modifications, Tries can support regular expression matching.
Tries are deterministic; the same input always leads to the same path.
Tries are scalable and can be distributed.
Each node can track how many words pass through it.
This helps in counting and ranking search suggestions.
Tries are powerful for linguistic and NLP tasks.
They are a backbone for many auto-correction systems.
Learning Tries strengthens understanding of trees and strings.
Tries are one of the most practical data structures in text processing.
